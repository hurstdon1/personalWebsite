	<p>The Keyword Generator Program was something I created as part of a group project for a software engineering course.
		The project uses a series of REST APIs to start with the name of a video game before ultimately delivering a word/image cloud of words associated with the game.
	</p>

	<p>My portion of the project does the following:</p>


<div class='pl-5'id="Keyword_list">
	<ul>
		<li>Takes user input in the form of a text document</li>
		<li>This input can be sent via an api route or uploaded directly to the site via a dropzone</li>
		<li>The program then breaks apart the json data and extracts a list of keywords based on their weight</li>
		<li>Built using Python/Flask, and SQL</li>
	</ul>
